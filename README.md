Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning
Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality worldwide, making early detection crucial. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of heart disease, aiding in early intervention and preventive care.

Project Overview
This study applies multiple machine learning models to classify whether a patient is at risk of heart disease based on various medical parameters. The dataset used comes from Kaggle and contains structured patient health records.

Methodology
The data underwent preprocessing, including handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection. Several classification algorithms were trained and evaluated to identify the most effective predictive model.

Machine Learning Models Implemented
Logistic Regression
Na√Øve Bayes
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree
Random Forest
XGBoost
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with one hidden layer
Performance
Among all models tested, Random Forest yielded the highest accuracy at 95%, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting heart disease based on given parameters.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle: Heart Disease UCI Dataset

Usage
Install Python and required libraries (Scikit-learn, Keras, Pandas, etc.).
Download the dataset from Kaggle.
